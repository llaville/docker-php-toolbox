# How to add a new tool with composer install command lines

## What you'll learn ?

- define a new tool in JSON format that will be installed by composer install
- update your `Dockerfile` work image to install the new tool

## Audience

Developers, DevOps engineers, and Contributors with PHP/JSON (and Docker) skill.

**Steps to complete this course: 3**

To follow this course, we will add the [phplint](https://github.com/overtrue/phplint) project as new tool into your PHP container.

## Step 1 - define the new tool

In your favorite `resources` directory that should have at least two sub-directories (`extensions` and `tools`),
add a new JSON file (i.e: `phplint.json`, but you are free to use whatever you want as filename), with following contents:

```json
{
    "tools": [
        {
            "name": "phplint v3",
            "summary": "Checks PHP file syntax",
            "website": "https://github.com/overtrue/phplint",
            "command": {
                "composer-install": {
                    "repository": "https://github.com/overtrue/phplint.git",
                    "target-dir": "/usr/local/src/phplint",
                    "version": "8.0",
                    "scripts": false
                },
                "shell": {
                    "cmd": "ln -sf /usr/local/src/phplint/bin/phplint %target-dir%/phplint"
                }
            },
            "test": "",
            "tags": [
                "phplint-3",
                "exclude-php:5.2", "exclude-php:5.3", "exclude-php:5.4", "exclude-php:5.5", "exclude-php:5.6",
                "exclude-php:7.0", "exclude-php:7.1", "exclude-php:7.2", "exclude-php:7.3", "exclude-php:7.4"
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "phplint v2",
            "summary": "Checks PHP file syntax",
            "website": "https://github.com/overtrue/phplint",
            "command": {
                "composer-install": {
                    "repository": "https://github.com/overtrue/phplint.git",
                    "target-dir": "/usr/local/src/phplint",
                    "version": "7.4",
                    "scripts": false
                },
                "shell": {
                    "cmd": "ln -sf /usr/local/src/phplint/bin/phplint %target-dir%/phplint"
                }
            },
            "test": "",
            "tags": [
                "phplint-2",
                "exclude-php:5.2", "exclude-php:5.3", "exclude-php:5.4",
                "exclude-php:8.0", "exclude-php:8.1"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
The **tools/command** is mandatory and define how you'll grab a copy of the tool.

Here, we decide to install **phplint** with composer
This is done with `composer-install` and `sh` specialized commands.
See <https://github.com/llaville/docker-php-toolbox/blob/master/src/Command/ComposerInstallCommand.php>
and <https://github.com/llaville/docker-php-toolbox/blob/master/src/Command/ShellCommand.php>

By default, tools are installed in the `/usr/local/bin` directory.
To perform an installation in another location, don't forget to add the `%target-dir%` placeholder, to be able to replace it at runtime.

## Step 2 - (re)build the work Dockerfile

Before to rebuild the docker work image, you should update the work Dockerfile.
It can be done by running the following command:

```bash
bin/toolkit.php build:dockerfile -f ./Dockerfiles/work/Dockerfile <php_version>
```

Replace `<php_version>` by either 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0 or 8.1

**CAUTION** identify the right work Dockerfile with the `dockerfile` (or `f`) option. Default is for **mods** file.

**NOTE** if your `resources` directory is located in another location than the one bundle with this project,
don't forget to pass the `--resources` option.

**Example**

```bash
bin/toolkit.php build:dockerfile -f ./Dockerfiles/work/Dockerfile --resources /home/me/my-project/Dockerfiles/work/Dockerfile 7.4
```

Beware, if you plan to use this Toolbox for another target than the Devilbox project, don't forget to identify the right templates
of your Dockerfiles with the `f` or `dockerfile` option.

## Step 3 - (re)build the work Docker image

You are now ready to build the Docker work corresponding image with the following command:
```bash
bin/toolkit.php build:image -f ./Dockerfiles/work/Dockerfile <php_version>
```
