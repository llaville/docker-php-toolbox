# How to add a new tool with multiple command lines

## What you'll learn ?

- define a new tool in JSON format that will be installed by multiple command lines
- update your `Dockerfile` work image to install the new tool

## Audience

Developers, DevOps engineers, and Contributors with PHP/JSON (and Docker) skill.

> Steps to complete this course: 3

To follow this course, we will add the [mhsendmail](https://github.com/mailhog/mhsendmail) project as new tool into your PHP container.

## Step 1 - define the new tool

In your favorite `resources` directory that should have at least two sub-directories (`extensions` and `tools`),
add a new JSON file (i.e: `mhsendmail.json`, but you are free to use whatever you want as filename), with following contents:

```json
{
    "tools": [
        {
            "name": "mhsendmail",
            "summary": "sendmail for MailHog",
            "website": "https://github.com/BlueBambooStudios/mhsendmail",
            "command": {
                "file-download": {
                    "url": "https://github.com/BlueBambooStudios/mhsendmail/releases/download/v0.3.0/mhsendmail_%os%_%arch%",
                    "target": "/tmp/mhsendmail_%os%_%arch%"
                },
                "shell" : {
                    "cmd": "chmod +x /tmp/mhsendmail_%os%_%arch% && mv /tmp/mhsendmail_%os%_%arch% %target-dir%/mhsendmail"
                }
            },
            "test": "",
            "tags": ["sendmail"]
        }
    ]
}
```

**CAUTION** We will use this [fork](https://github.com/BlueBambooStudios/mhsendmail) and not the official project, or even the devilbox's fork.

Reason is that this fork provides the new version [0.3.0](https://github.com/BlueBambooStudios/mhsendmail/releases/tag/v0.3.0)
that fix a [compatibility issue](https://github.com/mailhog/mhsendmail/pull/19), with multi OS assets downloadable
(that is not the case of devilbox's fork).

The **tools/command** is mandatory and define how you'll grab a copy of the tool.

Here, we decide to install **mhsendmail** by downloading corresponding OS asset of your platform.
This is done with `file-download` and `sh` specialized commands.
See <https://github.com/llaville/docker-php-toolbox/blob/master/src/Command/FileDownloadCommand.php>
and <https://github.com/llaville/docker-php-toolbox/blob/master/src/Command/ShellCommand.php>

Don't forget to add the `%os%`, `%arch%` and `%target-dir%` placeholders, that will be replaced at runtime.
(i.e: `%os%` => linux, `%arch%` => 386, `%target-dir%` => /usr/local/bin)

## Step 2 - (re)build the work Dockerfile

Before to rebuild the docker work image, you should update the work Dockerfile.
It can be done by running the following command:

```bash
bin/toolkit.php build:dockerfile -f ./Dockerfiles/work/Dockerfile <php_version>
```

Replace `<php_version>` by either 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0 or 8.1

**CAUTION** identify the right work Dockerfile with the `dockerfile` (or `f`) option. Default is for **mods** file.

**NOTE** if your `resources` directory is located in another location than the one bundle with this project,
don't forget to pass the `--resources` option.

### Example

```bash
bin/toolkit.php build:dockerfile -f ./Dockerfiles/work/Dockerfile --resources /home/me/my-project/Dockerfiles/work/Dockerfile 7.4
```

Beware, if you plan to use this Toolbox for another target than the Devilbox project, don't forget to identify the right templates
of your Dockerfiles with the `f` or `dockerfile` option.

## Step 3 - (re)build the work Docker image

You are now ready to build the Docker work corresponding image with the following command:

```bash
bin/toolkit.php build:image -f ./Dockerfiles/work/Dockerfile <php_version>
```
